                <hr></hr>
                <p class = "feature-title text-white">It’s important to understand how most viruses (including COVID-19) work. 
                    Viruses evolve and adapt over time, meaning that scientists learn about how viruses work over time. 
                    There is so much that we don’t know about COVID-19 today, which is why it is important to stay updated and 
                    informed about the virus. Scientists around the world are working 24/7 to learn more about COVID-19, how it 
                    spreads so easily, how it originated, how to prevent it (a cure or vaccine) and much more.

                <hr></hr>
                <p class = "feature-title text-white">Make sure you are being mindful and respectful towards others if you choose to go 
                    out in public settings. If a store, business or restaurant requires you wear a mask or cloth face covering while inside 
                    their building, make sure you follow their guidelines out of respect for the business and the customers around you. Keep 
                    in mind that you may be asked to leave if you don’t follow store, business or restaurant policies.

                <hr></hr>

                <p class = "feature-title text-white">There is A LOT of misinformation about COVID-19 everywhere on the internet, ESPECIALLY 
                    on social media. I suggest relying on the eight resources I listed in the "home" page for credible and trustworthy information on COVID-19. 
                    Information is powerful. Being misinformed about COVID-19 or spreading myths and false information about the virus can cause 
                    harm towards others who are less-informed about COVID-19.

                    It’s important to note that you should NOT wear masks or cloth face coverings while exercising, as it can 
                    reduce your ability to breathe and cause difficulty breathing (according to the CDC). If you choose to wear 
                    a mask or cloth face covering, do it at your own risk.

                    it’s important to remain updated on any new policies that your school may put in place. Since a lot of schools 
                    plan to open in Fall 2020, it’s important to remain updated on any information your school provides about how 
                    they will be handling COVID-19.

                <hr></hr>
                <p class = "feature-title text-white">Not everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 needs to be hospitalized. 
                    Unless you develop severe symptoms or illness from COVID-19, it's best that you treat yourself at home rather 
                    than at the hospital (which may be overcrowded depending on where you live). Understand that priority access to hospitals 
                    for COVID-19 goes to people with severe symptoms or illness from COVID-19.

                <p class = "feature-title text-white">Mental health is important, especially at a time where the world is in the midst of 
                    a global pandemic. You may have lost a loved one, lost a job, feel isolated or alone, have loved ones working on the front

                <p class = "feature-title text-white">Communication is one of the biggest barriers that many people, including myself, 
                    face during this difficult time. Make sure that you’re doing your best to regularly communicate with your family members 
                    and loved ones, whether through a call, FaceTime, Zoom, WebEx meeting, etc. COVID-19 has made it difficult for people to 
                    have normal in-person events and activities, and has shifted many things to an online and virtual setting. There may be some 
                    family members, loved ones or friends who we haven’t seen in person for a while, so you make sure you try your best to communicate 
                    with them as much as possible!

                <p class = "feature-title text-white">Do your part! Try to follow as many preventive measures as you can when leaving your home 
                    and entering into a public setting. Slowing the spread of COVID-19 takes the combined effort of EVERYONE. I believe that life 
                    will get back to normal if everyone plays their part in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 and hopefully stop the spread 
                    in its tracks.
