                <p class = "feature-title text-white">Hi there! My name is Roan Numa and I’m currently a sophomore at Purdue University studying Computer Engineering. 
                    I decided to create this website to highlight basic and important information about the COVID-19 disease that I believe everyone should know. 
                    The information presented throughout the website (except my own advice) was collected from reliable sources and is not my own!
                    I’m not a doctor or scientist, but I hope this website is informative for you and those you may share it with.
                    I will try to update this website as much as possible, add any other important information,
                    and provide links / resources to other credible sites that provide much more detailed information about COVID-19.
                    Feel free to share this website with your friends and family!

            The original infections were linked to a live animal market and the virus is suspected by scientists to have

                According to the CDC, “8 out of 10 COVID-19 deaths reported in the U.S. have been in adults 65 years old and older”.

        Studies have shown that as you get older, your risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases. Adults aged 85 or older have the greatest risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to children, teens and young adults who pose the 
        least risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Below are lists of underlying medical conditions that can make you at a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

        <p class="text-white">There is much less information known about the long term effects of COVID-19 since the virus was discovered in December 2019. 
           Because COVID-19 acts like a respiratory disease (affecting the lungs), people with severe symptoms or illness from COVID-19 could 
           develop permanent lung damage or fibrosis. Lung damage could also affect the function of other organs such as the heart, kidneys and brain.

    <p class = "feature-title text-white span" >The <u><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases" target="_blank" class="text-white">COVID-19 "curve"</a></u> 
       is a term used to describe two curves that are graphed on a statistical chart that describes what the spread of the virus looks like with and without protective measures. 
       The dotted line on the graph represents the peak capacity of the health care system to care for a projected number of patients.

            <p>Having steep curves means that there is a surge in COVID-19 cases and a lot of people will need medical care at the same time. 
               Having smooth curves means that there is a slow spread of COVID-19 and much less cases, meaning that people won’t be needing significant medical care at the same time.   
            </p>

            <p> </p>

            <p>To “flatten the curve” means to slow the spread of COVID-19. If everyone were to take preventive measures such as wearing masks & cloth face covering, maintaining 
               social distancing and more, we can be able to slow the spread of COVID-19 and help save millions of lives.
